## Major Prerequisites

Completion of [CS 111](../cs111).

## Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to...

+ Discuss language evaluation criteria and programming language paradigms.

+ Design and interpret context-free grammars using Backus-Naur form, extended BNF, and attribute grammars.

+ Employ syntax derivations, operational semantics, denotational semantics, and axiomatic semantics to evaluate the forms and meanings of sentences in programming languages.

+ Sketch finite-state automata, construct regular expressions, and design and implement lexical analyzers and recursive descent parsers in code to recognize the syntax and semantics of context-free languages.

+ Compare and contrast different implementations of common language features including declarations, expressions, statements, assignments, data types, branching structures, and repetition structures.

+ Distinguish the designs and behavior of subprograms.

+ Distinguish the imperative and declarative programming paradigms, including functional languages and logical languages, and translate program source code among them.

+ Explain concurrency in development using language features such as semaphores and mutexes.

+ Appraise the most suitable languages, techniques, paradigms, algorithms, and features for completing practical tasks.

Full syllabus is available upon request.

## Textbook

The **recommended** text is _Concepts of Programming Languages_ 11th Edition by Robert Sebesta (`ISBN 978-0-13-394302-3`, out of print) for reading and reference. Older or newer editions are acceptable. Because most of the out-of-class work will be completed in teams, it is reasonable for team members to share a copy or two as long as everyone has reliable access.
