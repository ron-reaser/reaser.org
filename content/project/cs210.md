## Prerequisites

Mastery of college algebra. Intermediate Java programming in [CS 111](../cs111).

## Learning Outcomes

<i class="fa fa-file-code-o fa-2x fa-pull-left fa-border" aria-hidden="true"></i> Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to program efficiently in Java at an experienced level. Students will utilize a test-driven development cycle to implement a novice relational database management system supporting a simplified subset of Structured Query Language and stored using serializable hash maps. Students will cement their foundation for future programming courses and will reinforce supplemental topics such as regular expressions, unit testing, version control systems, and standardized data interchange formats such as XML and JSON.
