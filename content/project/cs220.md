## Major Prerequisites

Completion of [CS 110](../cs110).

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this course, students will be able to...
1. Interpret and explain concepts in propositional logic and first-order predicate logic.
2. Employ proof-solving techniques including direct proof, proof by contradiction, and mathematical induction.
3. Interpret and explain concepts in set theory and counting.
4. Employ combinatorics and discrete probability to solve theoretical and practical problems.
5. Recognize binary relations, functions, and their properties, including orders of magnitude.
6. Employ graphs and graph algorithms to solve theoretical and practical problems in graph theory.
7. Apply the curriculum to improve mathematical abstraction and critical thinking abilities.

Full syllabus is available upon request.

## Textbook

The **required** text is _Mathematical Structures for Computer Science: Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications_ 7th Edition by Judith Gersting for reading, reference, and homework. The older 6th Edition of the book is acceptable.
