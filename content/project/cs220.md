## Prerequisites

Mastery of college algebra. Introductory Java programming in [CS 110](../cs110).

## Learning Outcomes

<i class="fa fa-superscript fa-2x fa-pull-left fa-border" aria-hidden="true"></i> Upon successful completion of this course, students will be well-versed in propositional and predicate logic; proof-solving techniques such as direct proof, contradiction, and mathematical induction; sets, counting, combinatorics, and probability; functions, binary relations, and recurrence relations; and graphs and algorithms upon them, as time allows. These topics will provide a broad mathematical foundation for future computer science courses and improve the logical and abstraction skills of the students.

## Textbook

The **required** text is _Mathematical Structures for Computer Science: Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications_ 7th Edition `ISBN 978-1-4292-1510-7` by Judith Gersting and it is necessary for readings, homework problems, and reference. You are responsible for any graded work you cannot complete due to lack of a book.
