<i class="fa fa-code-fork fa-2x fa-pull-left fa-border" aria-hidden="true"></i> Students interested in software development may apply to enroll in an independent study to work on one or more open source projects with Mr. Reaser and a team of student peers. The independent study gives experience in the software development lifecycle, version control systems, open source collaboration, web development, and cutting edge technologies. If interested, please contact the instructor directly.
