## Prerequisites

Software engineering in CS 230.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be experienced with database management systems (DBMS) and the design and theory of databases; they will understand the relational, object-relational, entity-relationship, and semi-structured data models, structured query language (SQL), Turing-complete SQL extensions with stored procedures such as PL/SQL, database normalization, and database storage structures; and they will be able to effectively develop databases and queries using Microsoft Access, Oracle Database, and MongoDB.

## Textbook

There is no assigned textbook. The instructor will cover many examples and concepts from _Fundamentals of Database Systems_ 7th Edition by Elmasri and Navathe `ISBN 978-0-13-397077-7` but it is not required. The older editions are comparable.
