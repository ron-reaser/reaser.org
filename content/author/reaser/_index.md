I am a Teaching Instructor with the [Lane Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering](https://lcsee.statler.wvu.edu/) of the [Statler College of Engineering and Mineral Resources](https://www.statler.wvu.edu/) at [West Virginia University](http://www.wvu.edu/) in Morgantown, WV.

I have over a decade of experience teaching undergraduates and graduates in computer science, software engineering, and mathematics.

My career goal is to better meet the academic needs of my students by improving the curriculum and assessment techniques in my field, by developing software tools and collaborative workflows, and by mentoring successive generations of educators and academic professionals.
