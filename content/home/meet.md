I meet with my students by appointment with generous weekly times and remote options available, rather than a narrow window of office hours on campus.

You can [schedule an appointment with me](https://calendly.com/reaser) on campus or remote during one of my posted time slots, which are during University [hours of operation](https://www.wvu.edu/faq/what-are-the-hours-of-operation-on-campus) on most weekdays except recesses.

You can also meet with me briefly before or after classes, as available.
