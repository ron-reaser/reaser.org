You can contact me or my teaching assistants via <a href="https://reaser.slack.com"><i class="fa fa-slack" aria-hidden="true"></i> our Slack team</a> to discuss topics related to courses or projects we are involved in together. You will need to sign-in or register using a school email address or else contact me to request a team invitation.
