# About

I am a computer science and mathematics lecturer with the [Lane Department](http://www.lcsee.cemr.wvu.edu/) of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering at [West Virginia University](http://www.wvu.edu/) with ten years experience teaching undergraduates.

My career goal is to develop improved curriculum and assessment techniques in computer science and mathematics education. I am currently pursuing the development of tools and services to assist computer science educators in their coursework.
