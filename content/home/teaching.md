I lecture regularly for the computer programming sequence CS 110, CS 111, and CS 210 and on a rotating basis for the foundational computer science theory courses CS 220 and CS 310. This is not an exhaustive list of every course I teach or have taught. I also offer opportunities in education and development for exemplary students by permission.
