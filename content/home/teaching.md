In my time as a lecturer at West Virginia University, I have overseen more than 50 course sections in computer science and mathematics with a typical course load of 3 courses per semester. I lecture regularly for the introductory through intermediate programming sequence of CS 110, CS 111, and CS 210 and on a rotating basis for the foundational theory courses CS 220 and CS 310. This is not an exhaustive list of all the courses I teach.
