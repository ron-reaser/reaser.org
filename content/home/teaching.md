I lecture regularly for the computer science major programming courses CS 110, CS 111, and CS 210, for the major theory courses CS 220 and CS 310, and and for the major elective course CS 440, among other offerings. I also mentor undergraduate proctors in the CS 490 teaching practicum. My course syllabi are available upon request.
