I lecture regularly for the foundational computer programming sequence CS 110, CS 111, and CS 210 and on a rotating basis for the foundational computer science theory courses CS 220 and CS 310 and the elective course CS 440. This is not an exhaustive list of every course I teach or have taught. I also offer practicums and mentorship for exemplary students by permission.
